## User Experience Flow

### Before:
1. User logs in
2. See "Setup Required" notice
3. Contact admin for API key
4. Configure API key in settings
5. Test connection
6. Finally create campaigns

### After:
1. User logs in
2. Immediately see campaigns dashboard
3. Click "Create Campaign"
4. Start making calls

## Features Available to Users

### ✅ What Users Can Do:
- Create and manage AI calling campaigns
- Configure campaign settings (name, description, voice, prompt)
- Make calls to leads
- View call history and analytics
- Access dashboard with statistics
- Test different voice options
- View call transcripts and recordings

### ❌ What Users Don't See:
- API key configuration

## Admin-Only Features

Administrators can still manage the centralized API key through:
- **Admin Dashboard** → **Settings Tab** → **Centralized API Management**

This keeps all technical configuration hidden from regular users while giving admins full control.

1. **Simplified Onboarding**: Users can start immediately
2. **Reduced Confusion**: No technical setup required
3. **Professional Appearance**: No third-party branding visible
4. **Better UX**: Streamlined interface focused on campaign creation
5. **Centralized Management**: Admins maintain control
6. **Scalability**: Single API key serves all users
